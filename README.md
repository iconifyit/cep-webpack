# cep-webpack

The goal of this project is to create a simple, well-organized Adobe CEP extension boilerplate built on Webpack that can be used as a foundation for progressive enhancements. So, for example, if you wanted to build a CEP paenel with React, Vue, or Angular, you could start with this repository as a submodule and add whatever enhancements you like without breaking the core or limiting your enhancements.
